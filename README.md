# ATM_Machine


In this assignment you will create a program that allows a user to do the following:

1)	Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password.
2)	Login using their id and password.
3)	Quit the program.

Now if login was successful the user will be able to do the following:

1)	Withdraw money.
2)	Deposit money.
3)	Request balance.
4)	Quit the program.

If login was not successful (for example the id or password did not match) then the user will be taken back to the introduction menu.

This is what your program in action will look like:
